## Hebbian Learning Model
This project implements a Hebbian Learning model where the user draws patterns on a 10x10 grid. The model is trained to distinguish between two patterns based on user input. After training, the user can test the model by drawing a new pattern to see if it correctly categorizes it as similar to one of the two original patterns. [See project folder](./hebb-model).
