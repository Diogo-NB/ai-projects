## Hebbian Learning & Perceptron Model
This project implements a Hebbian Learning model and a Single Layer Perceptron model where the user can draw and label patterns on a 10x10 grid. The model is then trained to distinguish between the two patterns. After training, the user can test the model by drawing a new pattern to see if the model can correctly label it based on the original patterns. See project folder.
